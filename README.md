LUFS - TruePeak
===============

LUFS - TruePeak is a program to measure LUFS volume loudness and true peaks.

LUFS volume loudness is a subjective loudness, calculated as recommended by
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialized
agency for information and communication technologies.

True peak is an estimate of the peak value in the corresponding electric 
or analog signal. 

The used algorithms are that specified by
document [BS 1770 from ITU](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1770/).

This program was developed using the [JUCE](http://juce.com) framework,
and ASIO and VST technologies by [Steinberg Media Technologies](http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html).
